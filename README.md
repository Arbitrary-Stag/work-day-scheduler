# work-day-scheduler

## Description
This is the fifth challenge of the UC Berkeley Web Development bootcamp in which we were challenged to make edits to a starter code they provided for a simple work day scheduling app. We were responsible for writing the code that would apply certain classes to html elements based on the time of the day by taking advantage of dayjs as well as being able to store and retrieve locally stored scheduled events.

## Installation 
N/A

## Usage
Once the user has navigated to the webpage they will be greeted by an app title followed by a line declaring the current date. Depending on the time of day certain time blocks may appear grey in color while those that have yet to pass will appear green and the current hour in red. There is a text field in each row in which the user can type in specific events they wish to schedule for themselves and then save that data to local storage with the click of a button on the right side of the row.

## Credits
This code was written by William Weaver, using the assistance of class materials, google search engine, various youtube tutorials, and the assistance of classmate John Owed.
